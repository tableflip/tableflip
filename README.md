# TABLEFLIP

_What is it & how does it?_

What follows is an outline of how and why we'd establish TABLEFLIP as a workers co-operative, and what that might look like. It is a living document, thoughts and constructive feedback is encouraged.

## What is a workers cooperative?

> A business owned and managed collectively by its workers for their mutual benefit.
> It’s organised democratically and fairly by (and only by) its members.

TABLEFLIP ia a group who create good code, and support the community through a commitment to open source ideas, education and meet-ups.

We benefit from being a co-op by committing to the idea that we all get a say in how we work together. By agreeing how we share the workload and profits we can balance our time between client work and less financially profitable ideas, that could have a much wider benefit.

By agreeing how we handle quiet times where the bank balance dwindles, we can ride it out as a team, sharing the resources fairly, until good times return, or, after working with a crew of good people that can all learn something from each other, we decide to pack it in and go do something else, with more ideas in our heads.

From my point of view the purpose of TABLEFLIP becomes one of protecting the people in it from the rougher edges of freelancing. To give us just enough structure and support to do good work without burning out, or having to do too much work of dubious value, just to pay the bills. Ideally, by looking after the people who are in it, it will free up time and headspace for them to go help others. Step one is make it work for us.

## What is a co-op, what is a company?

The "company" and the "co-op" are different things. Related, but different.

TABLEFLIP is a "Private Limited Company" registered at Companies House on the 4th September 2013 as "TABLEFLIP LIMITED", company number 8675539. [There is a certificate to prove it.][2]

For our purposes, British law offers no formal definition of a co-operative. It is an agreement amongst participants rather than a legal entity.

The principles that underpin a coop are:

1. Co-op membership is open and voluntary.
2. Co-ops are controlled only by their members, who each have equal control.
3. Members have a fair stake in the co-op. Investment does not give control and only gives a small return.
4. Co-ops are autonomous and independent self-help organisations.
5. Co-ops educate and train their members so they can contribute to the co-op. We also inform the public about the benefits of co-operation.
6. Co-operation among co-ops benefits members and the wider co-op movement.
7. Co-ops act with concern for the community.

- Replacing an expoltative boss with self explotation!
